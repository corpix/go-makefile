* DONE Divide package and application
  CLOSED: [2017-07-11 Tue 23:57]
  They should have different =Makefile= content.
  In case of application we need =ldflags= and other things
  which irrelevant to package.
* TODO Default version policy
* TODO Stop using random build id
  Random build id was a quick decision made to build code
  into RPM packages, now I think it is a good idea to have
  predictable build id which should be repeatable and based
  on version.
* TODO User defined includes
* TODO Cache file
  Generate a cache file which could be save in project repository
  to regenerate =Makefile= in the future.
