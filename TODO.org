* DONE Divide package and application
  CLOSED: [2017-07-11 Tue 23:57]
  They should have different =Makefile= content.
  In case of application we need =ldflags= and other things
  which irrelevant to package.
* DONE Default version policy

* DONE Stop using random build id
  CLOSED: [2017-07-12 Wed 00:11]
  Random build id was a quick decision made to build code
  into RPM packages, now I think it is a good idea to have
  predictable build id which should be repeatable and based
  on version.
* DONE User defined includes
  CLOSED: [2017-07-12 Wed 00:21]
* TODO Cache file
  Generate a cache file which could be save in project repository
  to regenerate =Makefile= in the future.
